# Shopify-Devloper-Challenge
This project was done using both HTML, CSS and PHP
For this challenge, there are four files in total that contribute to the run of this project.

User Side:

Create inventory items
1)The user first views a table of content on the inventtory data and then has the choice to either create, edit or delete an item from the list.
2)When user clicks on "create inventory item", they should be redirected to a user.php file document where the user can register both their information and the items information.
3)After the user has registered into the list, they should be taken back to the display.php which will show the new row of data that has been included into the list

Edit Items
1) When user clicks on the Edit Item tab, The will be redirected to an update.php file where each row value is updated based on their id number.
2) One's Item is edited, the user is then redirected back to the main display.php file where they can view the column value that has just been updated, as well as the other row values that hasn't been modified.

Delete Items
1) Ones the user clicks on the delete button, they would automatically delete the row values of the id they are deleting.

As requested for this project, the has the ability to create warehouses/locations and assign their inventory item to a specific shipment locations.
This way, the managers keeping track of each item needing to be shipped would able to copy and paste the locations that users have documented where they would like their item stored.

There is also a radio button included to let the managers know the priority for each shipment based on each items and policy of the logistics company.
